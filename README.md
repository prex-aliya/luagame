This is a small game made with lua, and the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/)
framework. This is a small game witch started with following a tutorial for
making an asteroids clone.

To run: 
```Code
love .
```


# Controls

| KEYS          | ACTIONS |
|---------------|---|
| w             | move forward |
| r/s           | move backwards/use nitro |
| h/left arrow  | move left |
| l/right arrow | move right |


# Dream

This is what I want it to eventually be, a infinite dungeon crawler, through
three dimensional space, will start with two. With each floor of the dungeon
with its own ecosystem. 

May move to different framework, and language.
